# RANDOM-PASSWORD-GENERATOR
While exploring key JavaScript concepts like functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling, I challenged myself to build something practical â€” and here it is! With just a click, this tool generates a new strong password every time and even includes a copy-to-clipboard feature for ease of use. ðŸ§ âš¡

The interface is styled with clean and responsive CSS, and everything ties together with simple yet powerful JavaScript logic. This project really helped me connect the dots between design and functionality.
